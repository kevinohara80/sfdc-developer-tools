### IDE's

  * **Platforms**: Windows, MacOS, 
  * **Overview**:The Force.com IDE is a powerful client application for creating, modifying and deploying Force.com applications. Based on the Eclipse platform and built on the Tooling API, the Force.com IDE provides a comfortable environment for programmers familiar with integrated development environments, letting you code, compile, test, package, and deploy all from within the IDE. Much of the actual work, such as compilation, happens on the Force.com platformâ€”the Force.com IDE performs the communication and result parsing transparently.
